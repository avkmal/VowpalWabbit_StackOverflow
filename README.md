This repository contains the training and testing code of 10 millions Stack Overflow questions dataset. The dataset 
can be downloaded [here]("https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZU4J3KhJDrHVMj48fROFcTsTZKorPGlG/view?usp=sharing").


To-do-lists:
- Create full tutorial on training until testing.
- Make the code more reproducible. Some of the training and testing code requires your own local path.
